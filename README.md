# User Management API
This is a simple REST API for user management, built with Node.js and Express.

### Features
- Password encryption
- Bearer token authentication (i.e., the `/user` endpoint requires admin access)
- Knex and SQLite3 to store user data

This was made with lots of help from [this tutorial](https://blog.postman.com/how-to-create-a-rest-api-with-node-js-and-express/#1).
