# User Management API
This is a simple REST API for user management.

### Features
- Password encryption
- Bearer token authentication (i.e., the `/user` endpoint requires an admin)
- SQLite database to store users
- User login and registration

This was made with lots of help from [this tutorial](https://blog.postman.com/how-to-create-a-rest-api-with-node-js-and-express/#1).
