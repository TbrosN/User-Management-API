# User Management API
This is a simple REST API for user management. It allows users to register and login and features basic security features like password encryption and bearer token authentication. For instance, the `/user` branch, which displays all users in the app, is accesssible only by admins.

This was made with lots of help from [this tutorial](https://blog.postman.com/how-to-create-a-rest-api-with-node-js-and-express/#1).
